        <p>Waiting in line can be an enjoyable experience, but most of the time, it can be extremely frustrating and agonizing for both customer and store manager. In today's market, the competition is very intense. One business may potentially lose a customer just by making them wait.  Since queues are basic to both internal and external business processes, understanding the nature of it would lead to an increase in competitive advantage.</p>
        <p>There is always a trade-off decision in every queuing situation. As a manager, one must always comprehend the cost of improving service and the cost of waiting.</p>
        <p>At its most basic level, queuing involves the arrival of a customer at an establishment. Managers or business owners must always exercise control over these arrivals and must have good understanding about a customer's need.</p>
        <p>However, to get a comprehensive understanding of the process, a manager or a business owner must be able to answer these questions to improve their service and gain competitive advantage:</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>How many workers/staff should I utilize?</li>
            <li>What's the average number of customers in line?</li>
            <li>What's the average wait time for customers in line?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Hiring more staff to handle the lines and interface with customers has the most noticeable effect in managing queues. It is important to hire the right balance of people in relation to the amount of customers that flow in and out of the business.</p>
        <p>For this reason, businesses also pay special attention to the amount of customers lining up in their business. This data is further broken down by time of day, season and other temporal factors. Figuring out when customers are most likely to line up for a service guides businesses on how many people to hire to interface with patrons at certain times.</p>
        <p>Finally, knowing the average waiting time for customers in line gives business owners a quantitative look at how well their operations are managing long lines. A long average waiting time for customers tells businesses that they need to optimize their operations; failing to do so may cost them return business from customers.</p>
        <h3>A Competitive Edge: More Than Reducing Costs</h3>
        <p>Having more staff members to attend to customers' needs improves line management significantly, but it does come with costs. Past a certain point, hiring staff members just to interface with customers becomes a costly affair. For smaller business operations, that money can be invested in other key areas.</p>
        <p>But more than saving up on employment costs, the real competitive edge in understanding queue management is in improving the waiting experience for customers.</p>
        <p>A clear understanding of queue management allows businesses to employ the optimum amount of people while also making the wait enjoyable for customers, saving you overhead costs and creating a loyal customer fan base eager to do business with you over and over again.</p>
